### "Development of an algorithm for detecting free parking spaces near residential buildings using neural networks"
During the course of the work, approaches to developing an algorithm for effectively searching and monitoring free parking spaces in the courtyards of residential buildings using neural network training were presented.


To develop the algorithm, a dataset was taken containing marked images of parking spaces in the courtyard of a house. Then the process of training several neural networks was considered, including marking a large data set and further adjustment on the selected dataset. Next, the process of training neural networks was examined in detail, as a result of which comparative statistics of the quality of detection and the learning speed of each neural network were formed.
